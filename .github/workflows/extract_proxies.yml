    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      # We checkout the default branch (main/master) to access the script and input file
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        # The git-auto-commit-action will handle checking out/committing to the target branch

      # Step 2: Set up PHP with the cURL extension
      - name: Setup PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: '8.x' # Use a recent PHP version
          extensions: curl   # Enable the cURL extension

      # Step 3: Run the PHP script
      # This script generates index.html and extracted_proxies.json in the current directory
      - name: Run PHP script to extract proxies
        run: php extract_proxies.php

      # Step 4: Commit and push the generated files back to the repository
